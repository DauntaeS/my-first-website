<p>
    I see myself really excelling in this field, while things are a bit challenging
     at the moment I truly belive that if I keep pressing forward anything is possible.
    I hope to be in a forward thinking tech company where I can really get behind their beliefs
     and become a valuable memeber of the team. </p>
